# EasyChemistry project

## Dwscription

The project should help with mastering a foundational skill for organic chemistry -- naming the structures

## Details

- 2D constructor of molecules
- shows the formula for the constructed alkane without radicals
- names it 
- uses Python + Pygame

## Instructions

- clicking the left mouse button creates a carbon
- clicking the left mouse button on existing carbon allows to drag it
